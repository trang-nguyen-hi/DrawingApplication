## Overview
A JavaFX drawing program that requires understanding of immediate-mode graphics, interaction with graphics, more complex model-view-controller architectures, and multiple synchronized visual representations of the model. There is a miniature view at the top-left (which shows the entire document) and the main surface (where user draws shapes) and both can be used for drawing, selection, and navigation.
